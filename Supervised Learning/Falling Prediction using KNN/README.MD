**DESCRIPTION**

k-Nearest Neighbors (k-NN) is a supervised machine learning algorithm used for classification and regression. Given a set of labeled examples, the algorithm tries to predict the class or the value of an unseen sample by finding the "k" closest examples in the feature space and aggregating the results (e.g., majority voting for classification and average for regression). The "k" is a hyperparameter that the user must set and determines the number of neighbors considered for the prediction.
